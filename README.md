# Distance-Vector-Network-Program
This program uses the Bellman Ford Algorthim to send a node down the most efficient path.
This project was completed for 3D3 Computer Networks Module as part of the MAI in Computer and Electronic Engineering in Trinity College Dublin
This program uses the Bellman Ford Algorthim to navigate through a network and adapt to the network if a Node has been removed or an additional router node is added to the network.
The program can be initalised using the Shell Script which will activate 6 routers A-F.
